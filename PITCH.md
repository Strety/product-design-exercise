# Pitch: Bookmarks Listing

**Appetite:** 6 hours

## The Idea

We already have bookmarking working. You can tap the bookmark icon on any post and it toggles on and off. But right now there's no way to see your bookmarks collected in one place. You bookmark stuff and then you have to scroll through all the posts hoping to spot the filled-in icon. Not great.

We need the listing side of bookmarks. Show bookmarked posts on the homepage as shortcuts, and give people a dedicated "My Bookmarks" page where they can see everything they've saved.

## Bookmarks on the Home Page

Bookmarks should show up on the homepage as actual links to the posts you've saved. Like a shortcuts section. Not a count, not a metric. You bookmarked these posts because you want to get back to them, so surface them as quick links.

Keep it lightweight. Just the post title as a link, maybe a small bookmark icon. Bookmarks shouldn't compete with the recent posts, that's still the main event. But they should feel useful, like a "your stuff" area on the page.

Only show this section if the user has bookmarks. If they've got nothing bookmarked, don't show it.

## My Bookmarks Page

A dedicated page that lists all your bookmarked posts.

- Show the post title, linking back to the original post
- Maybe a bookmark icon next to each one to keep it visually connected
- Ability to unbookmark right from this page. Don't make people navigate back to the original post just to remove a bookmark. Same pattern as the bookmark button on posts, just in a list context.

Similar UI to the posts index probably, but simpler since we're only showing title and unbookmark. No body preview needed.

## Getting to My Bookmarks

Where does the link to the bookmarks page live? A few options:

- In the navbar, next to "Posts"
- On the homepage, near the bookmarks section
- Both?

Hard to say which feels right without seeing it. Pick what feels natural and makes the feature discoverable without cluttering things up.
